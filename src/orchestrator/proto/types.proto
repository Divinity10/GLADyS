// ============================================================================
// SHARED TYPES - Cross-service boundary types
// ============================================================================
//
// PRINCIPLE: If a type is CREATED by service A and CONSUMED by service B,
// it belongs here. This prevents class mismatch errors when copying between
// proto messages from different packages.
//
// Examples:
//   - SalienceVector: created by Router, consumed by Memory → HERE
//   - Heuristic: created by Memory, consumed only by Memory → memory.proto
//   - Event: created by Orchestrator, consumed by Executive → common.proto (maybe here later)
//
// This file is synced to src/orchestrator/proto/ by proto_sync.py.

// Salience dimensions for event evaluation.
// Used in both Event (orchestrator routing) and EpisodicEvent (memory storage).
